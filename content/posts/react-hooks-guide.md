# Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features in functional components. In this post, we'll explore the most commonly used hooks and how to implement them effectively.

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to manage state and side effects in modern React applications.

## Essential Hooks

### useState Hook

The `useState` hook allows you to add state to functional components:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once on mount

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Only call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Use the dependency array correctly** - Include all values from component scope that are used inside the effect
3. **Custom hooks for reusable logic** - Extract component logic into custom hooks

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to manage state and side effects in functional components. By understanding and properly implementing these hooks, you can write cleaner, more maintainable React code.
